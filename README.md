# MotGen
MotGen: Bacterial Motility Generator 
We present the MotGen as a combination of Matlab image analysis code and ML workflow as a series of Python code using Jupyter Notebook. The ML workflow is a generative method for bacterial motility statistic features. The selected features extracted from live-cell images are delivered to a GAN model, and the imputed values are generated by using task-incremental learning. The example codes can be used as a template for cell tracking or implement trained models to generate bacterial motility statistics.
